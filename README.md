# 3d-house-project

### What?
This is a 3D house project for the Geospatial industry company *LIDAR PLANES*. 
Its objective is to build a solution to model **any house in 3D** with only a home address.
The solution development is based on *LIDAR PLANES*'s data: **DSM (Digital Surface Map)** and **DTM (Digital Terrain Map)**.
The data has been collected via the [LIDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) method.

The project is structured as follows:
```
3d-house-project/
|-- main.py :script that the end-user must run to execute the program.
|-- file1.py :
|-- directory/ :directory contains all the scripts to
|-- test/
|   |-- init.py
|   |   |-- test_main.py :to run all the unit tests
|-- README.md : explains the project and its structure
```

### Why?
*LIDAR PLANES* wants to create a 3D lookup of houses for its new branch in the insurance business.


### When?
It is a 2 weeks project.
The deadline to complete it is scheduled to `25/02/2021 at 5 p.m.`.

### How?
- [x] Collect *LIDAR PLANES*'s data
- [ ] Search and implement new librairies
- [ ] Read and use shapefiles
- [ ] Read and use geoTIFFs
- [ ] Render a 3D plot

### Who?
This project is carried out by **Van Frausum Derrick** from Theano 2.27 promotion at BeCode.
